Every time docker runs something, it creates image layer
If command remains same, it reuses the image!

Helps in making builds faster

Dont use caching aggressively

apt-get update might load from cache -> Resulting to old updates/


Use --no-cache=true with docker build for avoiding such issues.

Eg:

docker build -t jaylohokare/try . --no-cache=true
