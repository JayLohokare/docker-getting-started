Links wont work if high number of micro services

Use docker-compose.yaml file instead

Helps when many dockers 

No need to link -> names by default used as network identifies in V2.0

Stop all containers before starting compose commands.

docker stop ID 
#To stop existing containers

docker-compose up
#Starts all the containers!



docker-compose up -d 
#Background

docker-compose ps
#Show all containers running

docker-compose logs
#Shows all logs for all containers

docker-compose logs CONTAINER_NAME
#For specific container

docker-compose stop
#Stops without removing

docker-compose rm
#Remove everything. Data Lost


docker-compose up --build
#Build and run 

By default -> docker-compose up build only if image is new

To modify after making changes ->
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
